# algorithm to combine location history with current symptoms

# This region ( ) has confirmed cases of Corona Virus.

# Key gX = current gps location. cX = location of nearest confirmed case.
# |gX - cX| <= 3 meters {possible contact made with confirmed case. Score = ?}

# issue warning...step away from this area.

# Were you at mushin today? Yes/ No.
# Did you wear gloves, surgical mask... did you make physical contact with anybody?
# Notification: There is a possibility you might have been contaminated. I advice you self isolate.
# I will begin actively monitoring your symptoms.

# |gX - CX| > 3 meters {most likely no contact made with confirmed case. Score = ?}
